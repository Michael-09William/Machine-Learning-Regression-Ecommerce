# 🛍️ Ecommerce Spending Prediction
This project predicts the yearly amount a customer spends on an e-commerce platform using Linear Regression.
The goal is to understand how different customer features affect their spending behavior.

## Steps
1. Load and clean the data
2. Drop unnecessary columns
3. Scale features using StandardScaler
4. Train a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluate the model using MSE and R² score
6. Visualize the results

## Results
- Mean Squared Error: 96.38
- R² Score: 98.5%

## Libraries
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib



## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Execute `python src/Regression E-commerce.py`
